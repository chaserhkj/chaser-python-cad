# Personal Python CAD Creations

- Use with [build123d](https://github.com/gumyr/build123d) and preferably [vscode-ocp-cad-viewer](https://github.com/bernhard-42/vscode-ocp-cad-viewer)
- Projects may be moved to dedicated repos if getting bigger and needing better documentation
- Unless otherwise specified, all content are licensed under the following MIT license.

## Library

Library code is under `lib/`. Note that they are not organized into packages and you need to set `PYTHONPATH` to include that path in order for design files under `designs` to work.
